description: How Refreak collects, uses, and protects your data
---

This Privacy Policy explains how Refreak (the website and browser extension) handles your information.

Last updated: 2025-08-09

## Summary

- We do not collect, store, or sell personally identifiable information.
- We do not run analytics, advertising trackers, or use a payment processor.
- The browser extension may store your preferences locally in your browser only.

## What we do not collect

We do not collect any of the following categories of user data:

- Personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email, age, ID numbers)
- Health information
- Financial and payment information
- Authentication data (passwords, credentials, PINs)
- Personal communications (emails, SMS, chats)
- Location data (including IP geolocation)
- Browsing history
- Detailed user activity (clicks, keystrokes, scrolls)
- Website content (text, images, audio, video, or links) beyond what is necessary to render the page in your browser

## Information we collect

We do not collect or store personal data on our servers. We also do not use third‑party analytics or tracking cookies.

## Cookies and local storage

- Cookies: We do not set tracking cookies. Any essential cookies (if present) are strictly necessary for basic site functionality.
- Local storage: The Refreak extension may store user preferences and settings locally in your browser. These settings do not leave your device and are not transmitted to us.

## Permissions and data access (extension)

- Storage: used only to store extension preferences (feature toggles, UI language) and the on/off state between sessions.
- Host access (FACEIT domains/APIs): used to fetch player profiles, match statistics for smurf analysis, and team/player information in match rooms directly from FACEIT services. These requests are made by your browser to FACEIT; we do not proxy or persist this data on our servers.

We remove any permissions not strictly required for the extension’s single purpose.

## Analytics

- Extension: We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) configured to avoid collecting personal data (e.g., no PII, IP anonymization, advertising features disabled). GA4 is used only for aggregated, product‑improvement metrics.
- Website: We use Vercel Analytics for basic, privacy‑respecting metrics. We do not use third‑party advertising trackers.

## Third parties

We do not share personal data with advertising networks, data brokers, or payment processors. Access to FACEIT content occurs directly between your browser and FACEIT. Aggregated analytics (as described above) may be processed by GA4 and Vercel under their respective policies, with privacy‑preserving settings enabled.

## Remote code

We do not use remote code execution permissions in the extension.

## Data retention and security

Because we do not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data retention on our side. We still apply best practices to secure our infrastructure and prevent unauthorized access.

## Children’s privacy

Refreak is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page. Material changes will be highlighted when applicable.
