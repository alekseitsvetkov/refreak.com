# Refreak

An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13.

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
