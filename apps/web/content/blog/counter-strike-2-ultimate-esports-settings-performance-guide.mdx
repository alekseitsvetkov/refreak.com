## TL;DR

- **Target frame pacing over raw FPS**: unlock framerate but cap with `fps_max` near your monitor refresh for consistent frametimes.
- **Use Fullscreen and Reflex**: Fullscreen (exclusive) + NVIDIA Reflex On+Boost or AMD Anti‑Lag for lowest latency.
- **Competitive video preset**: everything low/off except textures on low/medium for clarity; reduce post‑processing.
- **Sound wins rounds**: HRTF on, master volume high, music low, disable spatial audio in Windows.
- **Crosshair + sens**: small static crosshair, raw input on, 400–800 DPI, eDPI 800–1600 as a baseline.
- **Radar/HUD**: not centered, lower scale, readable colors. You must read info fast.
- **Autoexec + binds**: centralize settings; add jump‑throw, quick‑drop, and smart buy binds.
- **Practice with intention**: structured micro + macro routine; review demos every week.

## System Prep and Drivers

- **Clean‑install GPU drivers** (NVIDIA/AMD). Enable shader cache; keep the control panel lean.
- **Windows**: Game Mode on, Hardware‑Accelerated GPU Scheduling on, set Power Plan to High Performance. Disable background overlays you don’t need (browser hardware acceleration, Discord/HW accel if unstable).
- **Storage**: Install CS2 on an SSD/NVMe. Keep 15% free space for cache.
- **Monitoring**: Use a lightweight overlay (Afterburner/RTSS) to track frametime, CPU/GPU usage, and VRAM. Optimize for the smoothest frametime line, not the biggest FPS number.

## In‑Game Video Settings (Esports‑Focused)

Aim: reduce latency, maximize visibility, minimize clutter.

- **Display Mode**: Fullscreen (not windowed). Lowest latency and best frametimes.
- **Resolution**: Native for clarity or a familiar stretch (e.g., 1280×960). Pick what you consistently hit shots with.
- **Refresh Rate**: Match your monitor; ensure Windows and GPU panel are set correctly.
- **NVIDIA Reflex**: On + Boost. AMD: Anti‑Lag/Anti‑Lag+ enabled in driver.
- **V‑Sync**: Off in‑game. See latency section below for sync strategies.
- **Texture Detail**: Low/Medium — Medium if VRAM allows; player readability improves slightly.
- **Texture Filtering**: Bilinear/Trilinear. Lower cost, acceptable clarity.
- **Global Shadow Quality**: Low. Keep enemy silhouettes readable without heavy cost.
- **Model/Shader Detail**: Low.
- **Effects, Post‑Processing, Ambient Occlusion**: Low/Off.
- **Vignette, Motion Blur, Film Grain**: Off.
- **Multisampling/Anti‑Aliasing**: Off or lowest. Favor clarity and FPS; test if a light TAA variant helps you.
- **Shader Pre‑Caching**: Enabled; let it finish after major updates.

### Recommended Presets by Hardware Tier

- **240–360 Hz esports build**: everything low/off; Reflex On+Boost; fps cap near refresh; textures low/medium.
- **144–240 Hz mid‑range**: same as above; consider slightly higher textures if VRAM is fine.
- **Entry 60–144 Hz**: prioritize consistent frametimes; cap `fps_max` just above refresh; keep effects/post off.

## GPU Control Panel Settings

Keep the game in control wherever possible.

- **Low Latency**: NVIDIA Reflex in‑game; otherwise NVIDIA Low Latency Mode Ultra (per‑app). AMD: Anti‑Lag in driver.
- **V‑Sync**: Off globally; if you use G‑SYNC/FreeSync, enable it for Fullscreen, leave in‑game V‑Sync off. If you want tear‑free with minimal lag, you can use driver V‑Sync + fps cap a few frames below refresh; test carefully.
- **Max Frame Rate**: Prefer in‑game `fps_max` over driver cap for stability.
- **Power Management**: Prefer maximum performance (per‑app profile for CS2).
- **Image Sharpening**: Optional; mild sharpening can aid clarity without AA.

## Frame Rate, V‑Sync, and Latency

- **Cap sensibly**: `fps_max 0` unlocks, but competitive players should use a cap near monitor refresh for steady frametimes (e.g., 235 on 240 Hz).
- **Separate UI cap**: `fps_max_ui 120` keeps menus light.
- **Reflex/Anti‑Lag**: keep on; confirm no driver/in‑game feature duplication.
- **Background apps**: close capture/filters unless required; record with lightweight encoders if streaming.

## Input: Sensitivity, DPI, Crosshair, and Raw Input

- **Raw Input**: On.
- **Windows Pointer Speed**: 6/11; Enhance Pointer Precision off.
- **DPI**: 400–800. Keep it standard for muscle memory portability.
- **eDPI**: DPI × in‑game sens. Start 800–1600 eDPI; adjust after 2–3 practice days, not mid‑match.
- **Zoom Sensitivity**: 1.0 unless you have a scoped role preference.
- **Crosshair**: Small, static, high‑contrast. Avoid dynamic/flair; it hides errors instead of fixing them.

## Audio: Footsteps and Positional Cues

- **HRTF**: On. It enhances directional audio.
- **Master Volume**: High; keep music low (10–20%) or off. Round start/ten‑second music minimal.
- **Headset EQ**: slight mid‑high boost for footstep clarity; avoid heavy bass.
- **Windows**: disable Spatial Sound/Dolby/Windows Sonic for competitive play to avoid coloration.
- **Mic**: bind PTT; compress and gate in your VOIP software to keep comms clean.

## Network: Sub‑Tick, Rate, and Stability

CS2’s sub‑tick system reduces reliance on legacy tickrate cvars; focus on stability.

- **Connection**: wired Ethernet; avoid Wi‑Fi and power‑line adapters if possible.
- **Background**: stop cloud backups/updates while playing.
- **In‑game**: Use `cl_showfps 1` for a simple counter; avoid chasing netgraph scripts that don’t exist in CS2.

## Radar, HUD, and Clarity

You must read the minimap instantly without tunnel vision.

- `cl_radar_always_centered 0`
- `cl_radar_rotate 1`
- `cl_radar_scale 0.35` to `0.45` depending on preference
- `cl_radar_icon_scale_min 0.6`
- `hud_scaling 0.9` to `1.0` for readability
- Use high‑contrast UI colors; avoid novelty themes.

## Essential Binds

Place these in your `autoexec.cfg` (see next section).

```cfg
// Voice and comms
bind v "+voicerecord"

// Jump‑throw (consistent lineup release)
alias "+jumpthrow" "+jump;-attack"
alias "-jumpthrow" "-jump"
bind alt "+jumpthrow"

// Quick drop bomb and ping
bind b "drop; player_ping"

// Mouse wheel jump for consistency (optional)
bind mwheelup "+jump"; bind mwheeldown "+jump"

// Buy binds (numpad example)
bind kp_end "buy ak47; buy m4a1_silencer"
bind kp_downarrow "buy awp"
bind kp_pgdn "buy famas; buy galilar"
bind kp_leftarrow "buy kevlar"
bind kp_5 "buy vesthelm"
bind kp_rightarrow "buy defuser"
bind kp_home "buy hegrenade"
bind kp_uparrow "buy flashbang"
bind kp_pgup "buy smokegrenade"
bind kp_plus "buy molotov; buy incgrenade"
```

## Autoexec: Keep It Consistent

Create `autoexec.cfg` and execute it on launch.

1. Navigate to your CS2 cfg folder:
   `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`
2. Create `autoexec.cfg` and paste your settings.
3. Add Steam Launch Option: `+exec autoexec.cfg -novid`

Starter `autoexec.cfg`:

```cfg
// Frame rate and UI
fps_max 235
fps_max_ui 120

// Viewmodel (example — tune to preference)
viewmodel_fov 60
viewmodel_offset_x 2.5
viewmodel_offset_y 2
viewmodel_offset_z -2

// Radar & HUD
cl_radar_always_centered 0
cl_radar_scale 0.4
cl_radar_icon_scale_min 0.6
hud_scaling 0.95

// Input
m_rawinput 1
snd_mixahead 0.02

// Crosshair (example static crosshair)
cl_crosshairstyle 4
cl_crosshairsize 2
cl_crosshairgap -2
cl_crosshairthickness 1
cl_crosshairdot 0
cl_crosshairalpha 255

// Net/Info
cl_showfps 1
```

## Practice Routines That Actually Work

Build a 60–90 minute routine, 5–6 days a week. Track progress weekly.

- **Micro aim (10–15 min)**: click timing, micro‑flick control; keep sessions short to avoid fatigue.
- **Movement (10 min)**: strafe control, counter‑strafe consistency, jump‑peeks with crouch discipline.
- **Utility reps (15–20 min)**: 3–5 core nades per map/side; rehearse from spawn and while under light pressure.
- **Deathmatch (20–30 min)**: one‑tapping only for the first half, then controlled spray transfer.
- **VOD/demo (15–20 min)**: 2–3 key rounds; extract one mistake to fix next session.

## Utility and Map Work

- Create a private server and enable practice tools:

```cfg
sv_cheats 1
mp_warmup_end
mp_roundtime_defuse 60
mp_freezetime 0
mp_buytime 9999
mp_buy_anywhere 1
sv_infinite_ammo 1
ammo_grenade_limit_total 5
```

- Rehearse lineups under time pressure: start from spawn, buy, run the path, throw on cue, swap to the next.
- Track a small book of lineups (3 T‑side, 2 CT‑side per map) that your team actually uses.

## Demo Review and Data‑Driven Improvement

- **Pick 3 situations** you repeatedly misplay (e.g., over‑swinging 2vX, late rotates, bad post‑plant spacing).
- **Build rules** from mistakes (e.g., “trade within 0.25s on A Main,” “never re‑peek AWPer without utility”).
- **Team sync**: consolidate common setups and counter‑utility per map into a shared doc; rehearse weekly.

## Troubleshooting FPS and Stutter

- Verify game files after large updates.
- Clear shader caches after major driver changes; re‑enable pre‑caching and let it complete.
- Lower texture detail if VRAM usage is near max.
- Check background CPU spikes (security scans, cloud sync); whitelist the game or schedule outside scrims.
- If streaming, test NVENC/AV1 with lower b‑frames and capped fps to keep frametimes flat.

## FAQ

- **Do launch options matter?** Keep it minimal: `-novid +exec autoexec.cfg`. Avoid legacy CS:GO flags that no longer help.
- **Is stretched better than native?** Use what you’re consistent with. Native offers clarity; stretched can change perceived target size. Consistency > preference debates.
- **Best FPS settings?** The “best” is the most stable frametime you can achieve while maintaining visibility. Start with the competitive preset above and tweak textures and AA minimally.
- **What eDPI do pros use?** Most land between 800–1600 eDPI. If you’re learning, prioritize control over speed.
