Maximize your duel win rate in Counter-Strike 2 with a practical, measurable training system. This blueprint compresses what top players do into daily routines, mechanics drills, and data tracking that compounds over weeks—not just hours.

### Who this is for

- Players who want a proven routine to improve fast without burning out
- Ranks from Silver to Faceit 3K+ who want structure, not guesses
- Anyone plateaued in DM who isn’t seeing progress in officials

### What you’ll get

- A daily 45–90 minute routine with progressions for every skill level
- Clean mechanics: counter-strafing, pre-aim, peeking, recoil control
- Data model and KPIs to track improvement and fix bottlenecks
- A warmup that translates to matches—no empty grinding

## 1) Sensitivity, mouse, and consistency settings

Aim quality starts with consistency. Optimize once, then stop changing.

#### Sensitivity (cm/360 and eDPI)

- Recommended range: 28–46 cm/360 for rifles; slightly lower is fine for AWPing
- Formula: eDPI = in-game sensitivity × mouse DPI
- Stability beats perfection—pick a number and keep it 30+ days

Recommended starting points:

- DPI: 800
- Sensitivity: 1.2–1.8 (eDPI 960–1440)
- `zoom_sensitivity_ratio_mouse`: 1.0–1.1 (keep your AWP muscle memory predictable)

#### Polling rate and raw input

- Mouse polling: 1000 Hz (or 2000 Hz if your mouse/PC handles it stably)
- Enable raw input; disable OS mouse acceleration

#### Crosshair and viewmodel

- Use a static crosshair with high contrast on maps you play most
- Viewmodel minimal and out of the way: prioritize clear sight on head level

Once set, lock it in. Consistency > micro-optimizations.

## 2) The 45–90 minute daily routine

Choose the time block you can sustain for 5–6 days per week. Quality > length.

#### Structure overview

1) Micro-aim and click timing — 10–15 min  
2) Tracking and micro-corrections — 10–15 min  
3) Recoil control and spray transfers — 10–15 min  
4) Movement + peek mechanics — 10–15 min  
5) Game-speed integration (DM/scrim/retakes) — 15–30 min

You can do 45 minutes on busy days and extend to 90 when time allows.

#### 2.1 Micro-aim and click timing (10–15 min)

Goal: build crisp first-bullet accuracy and click timing at head height.

- Static head-height targets; focus on perfect alignment before firing
- Rhythm: exhale, align, click—no spam
- Track misses. If you whiff, pause, re-center, and re-engage deliberately

Progression: shrink target size weekly or increase distance at the same accuracy.

#### 2.2 Tracking and micro-corrections (10–15 min)

Goal: maintain crosshair on a moving head without over-correcting.

- Follow lateral and diagonal movement with minimal wrist input
- Correct with micro-adjustments, not big resets
- Practice target switching: head-to-head in under 300 ms

Progression: increase target speed only after you can stay smooth and stable.

#### 2.3 Recoil control and spray transfers (10–15 min)

Goal: master 10–15 bullet control and fast transfers without overpulling.

- 10-bullet bursts center-mass → head correction at bullet 3–4
- Spray two enemies with 300–450 ms transfer; reset crosshair between targets
- Alternate AK/M4/MP9 to learn tempo differences

Progression: reduce time between transfer targets while maintaining accuracy.

#### 2.4 Movement + peek mechanics (10–15 min)

Goal: clean counter-strafes and peek shapes that win net time-to-kill.

- Counter-strafe vs. bots: tap A/D → instant stop → click at head level
- Peek types: jiggle peek info, shoulder bait, tight-slice, and wide swing
- Build a habit: crosshair starts pre-aimed at common head angles before peek

Progression: add off-angles and faster peek speeds while keeping first-bullet accuracy.

#### 2.5 Game-speed integration (15–30 min)

Goal: transfer mechanics to real timing. Prioritize servers/modes that reward correct peeks and trading.

- 15 min headshot-only or rifle DM (focus: first-shot precision)  
- 15 min retakes/scrims (focus: trading, spacing, utility timing)

If time is tight, skip to integration—this is where habits stick.

## 3) Mechanics that actually win duels

#### Counter-strafing

- Tap A/D once to stop; click inside the first 120 ms window
- Drill: place crosshair where the head will be before the stop—no micro-flicks after

#### Pre-aim and pathing

- Memorize heads along your path. Your crosshair should arrive with your body
- Pre-aim beats reaction. Build paths for T-side entries and CT-side rotates

#### Peeking hierarchy

- Jiggle for info → reposition → commit or reroute  
- Shoulder bait to pull shots → punish re-peeks  
- Tight-slice on AWPers; wide swing riflers holding close corners

#### Off-angles and elevation

- Use elevation or half-step off-angles to break pre-aim. Move after one kill

#### Spray discipline

- 1–5 bullets for long range, 6–12 for mid, commit sprays only \< 8m

---

## 4) Utility that amplifies aim

Aim wins duels; utility creates winnable duels.

- Pop flashes: burst on a 0.5–0.7s teammate swing timer
- Isolation: smokes to remove crossfires, mollies to deny strong anchors
- Layered trades: two rifles swing on the flash fade for guaranteed refrags

Build a one-page utility sheet per map with: 2 pop flashes, 1 isolation smoke, 1 site-take plan.

---

## 5) Rank-based routines (pick your track)

#### Starter (Silver–Gold Nova) — 45 min

- 10 min micro-aim  
- 10 min tracking  
- 10 min recoil (10-bullet bursts)  
- 15 min HS-only DM

Focus: consistent crosshair at head height; stop changing sensitivity.

#### Intermediate (MG–LE–LEM) — 60 min

- 10 min micro-aim  
- 10 min tracking  
- 15 min recoil + transfers  
- 10 min peek mechanics  
- 15 min DM/retakes

Focus: counter-strafing and pre-aim routes on two comfort maps.

#### Advanced (Supreme–Global / Faceit 2–3K) — 75–90 min

- 10 min micro-aim  
- 15 min tracking  
- 15 min recoil + rapid transfers  
- 15 min peek mechanics (off-angles, elevation)  
- 20–35 min scrims/retakes with utility layer

Focus: reduce time-to-first-kill and increase first-duel success.

## 6) The data model: measure what matters

You improve what you measure. Track these weekly KPIs from match stats or your analytics tool of choice.

- First duel success rate (T/CT split) — target +5–10% over 4 weeks
- Headshot rate (rifles) — stable 30–45% indicates clean click timing
- ADR and KPR — watch for consistency, not single-game spikes
- Multi-kill round rate — correlates with spray transfer mastery
- Flash assist rate — proves you’re creating winnable fights

Suggested spreadsheet columns:

```
Date | Map | Role | First Duel % | HS% | ADR | KPR | Multi-Kill % | Flash Ast | Notes
```

Add a short note: what felt hard, what you’ll drill tomorrow.

## 7) Weekly schedule that avoids burnout

- Mon: Routine + DM integration  
- Tue: Routine + utility reps on primary map  
- Wed: Routine light + VOD review (30 min)  
- Thu: Routine + scrims  
- Fri: Routine + retakes  
- Sat: Matches only; short 15–20 min warmup  
- Sun: Off or VOD review only

Every 4th week, deload: cut volume by 30% but keep frequency.

---

## 8) VOD review: 30-minute template

Focus on repeatable issues, not highlight clips.

1) First duels lost: angle, timing, crosshair, or peek choice?  
2) Deaths while moving: missed counter-strafe or late stop?  
3) Bad spacing/trades: who peaked first and why?  
4) Utility waste: were your flashes creating real pressure?  
5) Economy mistakes: did your buys support your job that round?

Record one actionable fix. Add it to tomorrow’s drill.

---

## 9) Match-day warmup (20 minutes)

- 5 min micro-aim heads at your exact crosshair height  
- 5 min tracking and target switches  
- 5 min recoil and two spray transfers  
- 5 min peek mechanics and a few wide swings

Stop before fatigue. You want freshness, not exhaustion.

---

## 10) Common pitfalls and fast fixes

- Changing sensitivity weekly → lock for 30–60 days
- Aim looks good in bots but not in games → do integration (DM/retakes) daily
- Whiffing first shots → slow down; pre-aim, then click
- Losing to AWPers → tight-slice peeks and off-angles, not wide swings
- Getting multi-killed on entries → layer a pop flash; trade in pairs

---

## 11) Quick config checklist (stability and clarity)

- Raw input enabled; OS accel off  
- 1000 Hz polling, stable frame pacing  
- Consistent crosshair and minimalist viewmodel  
- Sound: clear footstep presence; avoid over-compressing dynamic range

These are about consistency and clarity, not chasing max FPS.

---

## 12) The 4-week challenge

Commit to the routine, log KPIs weekly, and make one small improvement per day. Most players notice a 5–15% increase in first duel success within 4 weeks when they stop changing settings and start training with intent.

### Copy, paste, and print

Daily (45–90 min):

- Micro-aim (10–15)  
- Tracking (10–15)  
- Recoil + transfers (10–15)  
- Peek mechanics (10–15)  
- DM/Retakes/Scrim (15–30)

Weekly:

- 2× utility sessions on your main map  
- 1× VOD review (30 min)  
- 1× deload day or off-day

Stick to the plan. Your aim will follow.
