<Callout>
  This playbook translates pro‑level structure into practical systems you can run today with a stack or even in solo queue. It’s designed to be actionable, repeatable, and easy to iterate week over week.
</Callout>

## TL;DR

- **Economy mastery**: treat every round as an investment. Think in cycles (3–5 rounds), not single buys.
- **Role clarity**: hard‑code responsibilities (Entry, Trader, Lurker, IGL, Anchor, Rotator, AWP). Reduce decision latency.
- **Mid‑round framework**: Info → Space → Numbers → Win Condition. Make one decisive move per 15–25 seconds.
- **Utility protocols**: pre‑call lineups + timings; standardize 2–3 map takes per side and 1–2 quick hits.
- **Defaults first**: earn info and chip damage before executes; punish pushes and rotate timings.
- **CT principles**: contain first, fight with numbers, trade utility not HP. Delay plants, not duels.
- **Round types**: anti‑eco safety, anti‑force separation, bonus rules, late‑loss saves.
- **Communication**: 6‑point comms; call intent, not narration.

## 1) Economy Mastery

Winning CS2 at scale is about managing cash momentum. Anchor your plan to 3–5 round cycles.

### Key thresholds (per player)

- Full rifle/utility: $4,700–$6,000 (AK/M4, full nades, kit on CT when needed)
- Light rifle/impact: $3,800–$4,600 (rifle + 2–3 nades)
- SMG pressure: $2,500–$3,500 (MP9/MAC‑10 + flash/smoke)
- Pistol armor: $1,000–$1,800 (armor + util for space/plant)

### Team economy rules

1. **Sync buys**: 4+ rifles or full save. Avoid 2 rifles + 3 pistols unless it’s a scripted pop.
2. **Protect bonus rounds**: prioritize farm guns in close range; build bank while threatening conversions.
3. **Exit expectations**: post‑plant? Budget 1–2 exit kills or a save when timer/positions are bad.
4. **Kit/defuse math (CT)**: at least 2 kits on gun rounds. No kits? Play retake with earlier stick/half.
5. **Drop logic**: strongest riflers first, then utility carriers. AWP only if you can afford support nades.

### Eco conversion plan (T)

- Priority: **plant + space**. Two flashes to isolate first duel, smoke for plant, trade lines pre‑aimed.
- Don’t chase exits unless plant is guaranteed. Guns saved > random 1v1s.

---

## 2) Roles and Responsibilities

Clarify jobs to reduce mid‑round chaos. One player can flex, but primary tags keep comms crisp.

- **IGL**: sets win condition each round; calls pace changes; triggers cancel/commit.
- **Entry**: wins first space; dies for info on scripts; names the next angle for the trader.
- **Trader**: arrives 0.25–0.5s behind entry; owns the second kill; stabilizes post‑plant.
- **Lurker**: pressure flank timings and rotations; punishes pushes; calls gaps.
- **Support**: pre‑loads utility, sets lineups, tracks opponent util; ensures flashes land on swing.
- **AWP**: opens or denies zones; repositions after first shot; calls where the rifle pack should path.
- **CT Anchor**: buys time with util and off‑angles; communicates plant denial paths.
- **CT Rotator**: arrives with a flash/smoke; takes first contact on retake with teammates syncing.

Role clarity lets you pre‑assign utility and pathing per strat.

## 3) Mid‑Round Decision Framework

Use a repeatable loop every 15–25 seconds:

1. **Info**: what did we learn? (kills, util seen, sound, radar, damage)
2. **Space**: what zones can we take for free or tradeably?
3. **Numbers**: do we have advantage? equal? down?
4. **Win Condition**: plant, save, exit kills, or isolate a site anchor.

### Simple trees

- 5v5 with info advantage → take forward space, hold 5 seconds, re‑hit with layer 2 util.
- 4v5 down a player → isolate a 2v1 (contact into flash pop) or fake/late split for plant.
- 5v4 up a player → stabilize: no solo fights, group for trade paths, plant safe, deny retake util.

Decide once, then execute at pace. Avoid hovering in mid‑map with no objective.

## 4) Utility Protocols and Timings

Utility wins rounds before bullets are fired. Standardize timing words and lineups.

### Timing language

- **“Pop in 3…2…1”**: swing on 0.2–0.3s after last count.
- **“Chain”**: second flash lands as the first fades to catch anti‑flashers.
- **“Molly first”**: clear common anchor position before smoke lands.
- **“Cage”**: two smokes to cut re‑peek angles; scale into the cage, not through it.

### Pre‑assignments

- Player A: entry path smoke; Player B: pop flash; Player C: molly anchor; Player D: late lurk flash; Player E: plant/cover.

### Util budgets (per rifle round)

- T‑side: 3 flashes, 2 smokes, 1 molly minimum across the first two in.
- CT‑side: 1 early info flash, 1 deny smoke, 1 retake flash/molly saved.

---

## 5) T‑Side: Defaults, Hits, and Conversions

### Defaults that earn options

- Take early safe space with one flash. Hold push‑paths with crossfires.
- Deny CT info (smoke/cage key vision lines). Punish their re‑takes of map control.
- Lurker mirrors pack distance; if CTs double push, pack commits to opposite end with instant pace.

### Executions

- Have two speeds: a 25–35s layered hit and a 12–18s “pop” for timing punishes.
- On commitment: no dry peeks into expected angles; flash every swing that crosses multiple angles.
- Plant rules: plant where you can defend with two angles and one piece of utility.

### Conversions after plant

- Establish **one off‑angle + one trade angle**. Don’t double swing the same path.
- Use late util to deny defuse: smoke bomb at 0:10, molly defuse line, pop flash on tap.
- If man‑down, stack a gamble side of site and play for half‑stick deny.

---

## 6) CT‑Side: Setups, Delays, and Retakes

### Contain first, then punish

- Early round: throw info flash/smoke to measure numbers. Do not donate first blood.
- Anchors: off‑angle for first; trade to a safer position; call for chain‑util from rotator.
- Rotators: arrive with a flash out. First action is to stabilize—not wide swing solo.

### Retake structure

1. Establish staging areas (two lanes). Count enemy util left if known.
2. Pop flash for first contact; smoke key line; molly default/headshot if applicable.
3. Trade pairs. One defuses; one holds tap. If kits are low, call early stick.

### Save logic

- If 2v4 with no utility and bomb is planted open with control lost, save rifles. Guns matter next round.

---

## 7) Round Types and Gameflow

### Pistols

- T: concise pop with double flash or split with a late flank. Plant priority > chase.
- CT: kit + smoke on one; stack a site only with fast rotate plan.

### Anti‑eco (vs. no armor or light buy)

- Rifles at distance; jump‑spot; clear close corners with utility. Don’t farm alone.

### Anti‑force (vs. pistols/armors, scouts)

- **Separation**: avoid tight corridors; smoke off force‑friendly angles; molly close boxes.
- Trade in pairs; deny their timing stacks with late bursts of utility.

### Bonus rounds

- High percentage play: group, isolate a single rifle with layered flashes, upgrade guns, then slow.

### 2k–3k bank resets

- If both teams low, call the round to set up the next two. Safe plants, exits, and saves beat heroics.

## 8) Communication System

Aim for information density, not word count.

### 6‑point comms

1. Enemy count and guns spotted.
2. Utility seen/used (e.g., "2 smokes A used").
3. Space taken or lost ("conceding mid", "taking ramp").
4. Your intent ("contact then pop", "saving", "retake in 3").
5. Trade plan ("swing on my flash").
6. Post‑plant setup or save call.

### Bad comms to remove

- Narration without intent, tilt, and late info. Replace with plans and timers.

---

## 9) Clutches, Post‑Plants, and Saves

### Clutch rules

- Clear loud zones first; isolate 1v1s; use the bomb timer to force peeks.
- Crosshair height > movement spam. Hold for re‑peeks after sound bait.

### Post‑plant protocols

- One watches bomb, one watches tap swing, one watches flank. Trade lines, not hero plays.
- Utility in reserve: always keep one piece to disrupt defuse or re‑take pathing.

### Save discipline

- If your save increases next round’s win chance by >15–20%, you save. Make it explicit.

---

## 10) Anti‑Strat and Adaptation

Build simple reads:

- CTs double‑nade a choke early twice → run mid‑round hit elsewhere with late util.
- Same AWP pick 3 rounds → deny the angle with smoke, punish rotation with lurk timing.
- Fast flanks spotted → anchor a lurker deeper or leave a trap with a bait.

Between halves or timeouts, pick two adjustments only. Overhauls mid‑match cause errors.

---

## 11) Map‑Agnostic Playbook Templates

Copy these and fill for your maps. Keep them to one page each.

### T‑Side Template

```
Map:

Defaults (2):
- Default A: early space, punish CT pushes, late regroup A/B (timings, util)
- Default B: as above

Hits (3):
- Hit #1 (slow layer): smokes, molly, two flashes, entry path
- Hit #2 (fast pop): one smoke, chain pop, scaling path
- Hit #3 (split): timings and lurk triggers

Mid‑round calls (2):
- Information play → pace change (call words)
- Fake/late split → plant priority

Post‑plant plans (2):
- Open plant: crossfires, util timings
- Closed plant: off‑angle + trade angle
```

### CT‑Side Template

```
Map:

Default setups (2):
- Setup A: anchor spots, rotator util timings, AWP position
- Setup B: variation to deny opponent conditioning

Mid‑round moves (2):
- Info play with flash (who throws, who peeks)
- Late re‑take of map control (timers)

Retake plan (1 per site):
- Entry lanes, util order, stick rules, exit path if failed
```

---

## 12) Weekly Improvement Loop

Run a tight feedback cycle so your playbook compounds.

1. Pick one map/side and one round type to improve (e.g., T anti‑force).
2. Record 3 mistakes from officials/scrims.
3. Add one new protocol or adjust util timing.
4. Drill twice in practice; run it in 3 matches that week.
5. Review stats: entry success, retake success, plant conversions, save rates.

Keep it boring and consistent. That’s how teams and stacks climb.

---

### Final Word

You don’t need 40 strats—you need 5 that you execute cleanly under pressure. Define roles, pre‑assign utility, communicate intent, and run a weekly loop that steadily improves one piece at a time. The teams that win aren’t the flashiest—they’re the most repeatable.
