## Core Features

### Smurf Detection

- Analyzes player activity, rating swings, recent performance, and profile behavior.
- Highlights potential smurfs and risky accounts with **clear badges** in the lobby.
- Helps new players avoid unfair games and lets experienced stacks adapt picks/roles.

### Grenade Guides from the Lobby

- Open **curated grenade videos** for the current map right from FACEIT.
- Covers all major maps with reliable, up‑to‑date lineups for smokes, flashes, and mollies.
- Perfect for last‑minute refreshers before queue pops or veto finishes.

### Readable Player Cards

- Cleaner, more informative lobby context so you can read teams at a glance.
- Minimal noise; emphasizes the information that actually changes decisions.

### Pre‑Match Workflow

Use Refreak to make the first 60 seconds count:

1. Scan the lobby for smurf signals and risky profiles.
2. Decide between comfort picks vs. denial picks in veto.
3. Open the grenade panel for your likely map; share one lineup per site with the team.

## Quick Start: 30‑Second Checklist

- Open a FACEIT lobby page.
- Look for smurf/risk indicators on player cards.
- Click the Grenades module → pick your map → watch one lineup you’ll use first gun round.
- Share the video or key timing with your stack.

---

## Best Practices

- Treat indicators as **signals**, not verdicts; combine with your own read.
- Pick one smoke and one pop flash per site before the game starts.
- If a suspected smurf is on the enemy team, adjust veto towards maps where your team structure is strongest.

## Privacy and Security

Refreak is built with a **privacy‑first** approach:

- No invasive data collection; only the minimum required to enhance FACEIT pages.
- Runs locally in your browser; doesn’t require account logins.
- You can disable it per‑site at any time.

---

## Performance and Compatibility

- Built to be lightweight and responsive; it won’t slow down your browsing or FACEIT.
- Works best on Chromium‑based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave). Firefox support is planned.

---

## FAQ

- **Is this allowed on FACEIT?** Yes. It’s a browser UI helper and doesn’t interact with the game client.
- **Will it ban me in CS2?** No. It runs in your browser, not in the game.
- **Why did a player get flagged as a smurf?** Likely due to recent rating spikes, unusual performance vs. level, or fresh account behaviors.
- **Can I suggest grenade videos?** Yes — send feedback via the Chrome Web Store page.
