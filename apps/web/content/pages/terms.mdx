## 1. Definitions

“Service” means the Refreak website, APIs, and browser extension. “We/Us” means the Refreak team. “User” means any individual or entity using the Service.

## 2. Accounts and access

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account.
- We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or where required by law.

## 3. Billing

We do not offer paid plans or subscriptions, and we do not process payments. The product is free.

## 4. Acceptable use

You must not reverse engineer, attempt to bypass limitations, interfere with the Service, use it for illegal purposes, distribute malware, or exploit vulnerabilities without responsible disclosure. We may apply technical measures to protect the Service and our users.

## 5. Content and rights

## 6. Warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability

The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not warrant uninterrupted operation, universal compatibility, or error‑free performance. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect damages, lost profits, data loss, or inability to use the Service.

## 7. Privacy

Use of the Service is governed by our Privacy Policy. We do not collect or store personal data. See the “Privacy Policy” page for details, including our use of GA4 (extension) with privacy‑preserving settings and Vercel Analytics (website).

## 8. Changes

We may update features or discontinue parts of the Service. We may also update these Terms from time to time. Your continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 9. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may terminate access for violations of these Terms or where required by law.
